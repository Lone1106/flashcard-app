# React Flashcard Application with Firebase

This is a very basic react flashcard app that lets you:

- Signup/Login as a user
- Add Flashcards
- View all Cards
- Delete Cards
- Study Cards

The flashcards are currently intented for vocabulary use, hence the length is capped at 50 signs!

_The app isnt completely finnished yet, however all functionality has been implemented_
