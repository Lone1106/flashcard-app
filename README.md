# React Flashcard Application with Firebase

This is a very basic react flashcard app that lets you:

- Signup/Login as a user
- Add Flashcards
- View all Cards
- Delete Cards
- Study Cards
- Delete user
- Change password

_Reauthentication isnt fully implemented yet hence deleting a user or chaning password doesnt work fully yet._

Missing important features:

- Edit Flashcards
